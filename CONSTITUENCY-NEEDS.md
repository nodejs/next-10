## Good understanding of the direction of the project

* An understanding of the work happening in the Node.js project (what features do I have
to look forward to, what's the project direction). Changes between
  releases. More info on how new changes affect end users/developers
* Confidence in the health of the project upkeep and leadership
* Confidence that the project is well run and will continue being maintained/successful

## Ability to affect the direction of the project

* The ability to discover when important decisions are being
  made by the project.
* A seat at the table when important decisions are being made. 
* Ability to advocate for work (bug fixes and features) that unblocks customers
* A level playing field so that they have equal opportunity to contribute as other
  people and/or organizations

## Consumable APIs and Docs

* APIs and Docs which are up to date and simple to understand and use
* Example code for one or more use cases of the APIs

## Predictable and Stable Releases

* Predictable release schedule to be able to plan upgrades
* Compatibility and stability when possible across releases to minimize upgrade work
* Stability across runtime versions

## Innovation at a consumable pace

* Right balance between "move fast" and stability
* Stability while still trying out new things
* Advance notice and time to prepare for deprecations

## Easy Installation

* Ability to easily install/consume Node.js in different environments
  * raw OS, containers, cloud platforms etc.

## Easy issue reporting, resolution and collaboration

* A good path to report issues to the project, and the ability to collaborate/contribute to
  the project to get them addressed
* A clear understanding of how to interact with the Node.js project.

## Broad Deployment platform support

* Broad platform support for deployment OS and processor
  architectures

## Broad Desktop platform support

* Platform support that covers key desktop OS(windows, linux and OSX)

## Consistent and intuitive Error handling

* Error handling (traceability through tooling,long stack traces, system state reporting,etc)

## Runtime Diagnostic Tooling
* Diagnostics Tools
* More diagnostic signals
* Monitoring tools
* Observability

## Development time Diagnostic Tooling
* Debuggability
* Instrumentability

## Relevant APIs in core
* WebSockets in core (still waiting...)
* APIs in key areas across the different types of applications, CLI, web, cloud native etc.
* APIs they can use directly from core without intermediary deps

## Module/depenency info and management

More information, and easier ways to gather information about modules they depend on.

## Ways to fund their work
* Ways to fund their work

## Ability to asses impact of changes they make
* Tools to evaluate impact of updates they make on other packages/applications

## Reasonable resource usage/performance

* Resonable resource usage (cpu, memory etc.)
* Performance

## Good security and CVE practices in the project

* Good management, reporting and updates for security issues
* Good process/handling of CVE's by the project

## Better CVE management in the ecosystem

* Better ways to deal with reported vulnerabilties
* Better systems of keeping track of dependencies (updates, vulnerabilities, etc)

## Good CI infrastructure and experience in the project

* Good user experience with CI
* Easier ways for collaborators to add/modify CI jobs
* Make it easier for collaborators to understand failures in the CI
* Reasonable build time 

## Supportive Collaborators and Environment in the project

* More internals guides
* Supportive collaborators

## Better ways to build consensus in the project

* Better ways to build consensus for what new features/APIs should be added to Node.js
* Easier ways to resolve disagreements 
* Ability to push changes without burning out

## Easy contribution workflow
* More contribution workflow automation
