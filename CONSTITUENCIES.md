## Context

Having a clear idea of who are our constituencies will help us prioritize decisions as well as which features or changes should be included in the project. 

## List of constituencies

* Direct end users
  * Users who run tools themselves (install Node.js, run tool, deal with errors)
* Application operators
  * Users who interact with existing, running applications (regardless if they wrote the application or not)
* Application Developers
  * Front-end tool consumers
  * Back-end server authors
  * Hobby developers
  * Professional developers
  * Tool authors
* Library/package authors
  * Users who write libraries and packages to be included on other applications
* Node.js core maintainers
  * Developers working directly on [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
  * Individuals participating in Working Groups
* Organizations with investments in Node.js (eg: Enterprises, Government bodies, startups, non-profits)
