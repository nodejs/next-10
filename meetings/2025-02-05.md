* Zach
  * Looking at the data from the two surveys (2023-2024)
  * Was able to join the results from the two surveys to see if there is any major differences ]
    * Significant increase in arm usage
    * Interesting results based on Country of residence, lots of differences
    * Quite Europe based in terms of survey takers in both years
    * Increase in representation for North/South America in 2024
    * Which role was application developers for both years
    * Direct end-users proportion double in 2024
    * In terms of pain points, >⅙ asked for built in TypeScript
    * Version management is another recurring theme
      * People who want new features, but not breaking changes
        * Jacob working on effort around migrations which should help with that
    * Main pain points
      * 6 % of 300 responses said too slow
      * Lack of ESM supports (20 people), particularly CJS ↔︎ ESM
      * Lack of memory control, memory usage

* 2025 - Survey
  * Jean will be PR’ing in list of questions etc.
  * Jean will open tracking issue as well.

* DEI mentoring workshop happening [Wed, 12 Feb](https://github.com/nodejs/collaborators/discussions/213)
  * Good mentor interest/participation (multiple outside, ex a local edu org and an AI/data firm very excited to mentor, so not just web dev)
  * promising so far
  * Michael, is there something we can/should do as follow on in terms of follow on
  * Jacob, would be great to have more formal mentoring process. Great to have a buddy
  * Jean, in 2019 there was a mentorship program,
    * Michael true there have been a few attempts
  * Jacob, next step
  * Some good discussion
  * Goal is to identify 1 or 2 great candidates from the session and look for mentors for them
    afterwards.
* Longer-term solution: invite/nomination system (via collaborator) for promising contributor who we want to set on a "collaborator track"
* Need way to track available mentors and capacity, who is paired with who, etc

* Sessions for the upcoming collaborator summit in April
  * Mentorship system proposal - Jacob
