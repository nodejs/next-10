## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **next10-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* build: provide pre-built nodejs/node images or cache  [#39672](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39672)
  * Issue in admin repo to move repo that @bnb has been working on to the Node.js report -
    <https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641>
  * No objections so we just need to give access to right people and then it can be moved over

### nodejs/next-10

* Actions from next-10 summit
  * Opened this issue - <https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/104>
  * Discussion issue - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/40953>
  * PR to add style guide needed to parse docs
    * <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41025>
    * Next step is likely to close that PR and then open a new PR to add the structural changes
      needed into the existing style guide.
  * Think @bnb is working on that.
* Further explore Electron TypesParser to see if it can be used to generate JSON for Node.js project
* Looked at parser and created PR - <https://github.com/electron/docs-parser/pull/66>
  * There was another PR earlier that was larger change but likely more complete that
    stalled out.

* Planning for next mini-summit
  * Michael what would be the next to cover?
  * Jean, documentation would be good as it links to discussion around electron style
    guide as well as other issues that are in active discussion
  * Beth, Modern HTTP seems like a good choice. We should talk to the Undici team
    and James who is working on QUIC team to see if that makes sense.
    * Joe will reach out to them to start the discussion
    * James talks about HTTP3/QUIC <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZRDbQnNoc>
  * Lets target Thursday the 27th from 10-2 ET

* Lets cancel meeting on Dec 22nd.
