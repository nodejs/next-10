### nodejs/next-10

* Survey results
  * We spent most of the time going through the survey results
  * Q5 Role
    * 71% application developers
    * 11% direct end users
    * Is there anything we can do to get more from the other constituencies?
    * Very happy with the number of responses of 2939, versus 1677, so almost 2x last year.
  * Q6 Use case
    * 50% is developing APIs
    * 30% is deploying front ends
    * 8% is building static front ends
    * 10% scripting and CLI tools
    * Missed category for desktop and mobile applications (electron, cordova), also missed IoT, should also include all of the above. Would also be good to pull out people using SEA, bundled binaries
  * Q7 Operating system
    * Mac was the highest 43%
    * Windows was 27%-33%
    * Linux 22%
    * Interesting that only 11% were using docker
  * Q8  Production env
    * Linux 85%, with docker being 30% of that
    * Would be good to be more specific on the wording, for example:
      * Bare metal Linux
      * Linux host with Containers
    * Should include
      * all of the above
      * serverless
  * Q9 - architecture
    * 68% x64
    * 23% arm, might be coming from Mac usage
    * Would have been good to ask if architecture was production or development?
  * Q10 - how do you get your Node executables
    * Node version manager 60%
    * installers 14%
    * Should include -> through containers for the next year
    * Might be interesting to ask for development and production
