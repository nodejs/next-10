  * discussion around security policy/supporting info
  * We could write up some cases where security compromise made sense
  * Darcy - might be good as practice to start documenting when 2 values are at odds
    When we make a decision, capture its somewhere
  * Key thing could be to build process/data to help project make decisions with conflicting
     values/constituencies, start by documenting historical data
  * Also discussed well defined security model, and supporting pieces could be one of the
    important things
