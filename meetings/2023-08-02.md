* Next-10 next survey [#152](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/152)
  * Went through detailed results today
    * Interesting that 61% of respondents were in Europe.  
      * Is it because people in NA are using Twitter less?
    * Action:  ask Kylie if she has any insight as to why there would have been more visibility in Europe
    * In terms of organization
      * Might be interesting to split technology company by industry
      * Might also be interesting to have the size of company
    * Interesting that there is 15% for Ops/DevOps which is higher than Mobile and Desktop. Might be higher than we had imagined.  
    * In terms of environment might be worth mentioning WSL next time as there where quite a few write ins.
    * Action: -> Would it make sense for the team to look for ESM success stories and help get them published.
    * Multithreading and debugging show up in write in problems, might be an area for more documentation, document curation to help point to available resources.

* Create Communications Channel to JS Newsletters/Periodicals [#110](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/110)
