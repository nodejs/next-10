## Message for promotion (Example format based on brainstorm, with a few of the top messages as examples)

### Thread model and security vulnerability reporting

#### Goal

Build a better community understanding of the Node.js threat model and how to properly report security issues. We often have people opening public issues in repo versus reporting through Hacker One.

### Node.js is your best choice for a JavaScript runtime

#### Goal

Highlight all of the reasons why Node.js is the best choice for a JavaScript runtime. These include:

* defines the defacto standard API, so most likely to be compatible with modules
* large number of platforms supported
* how widely it is used
* openness of the project
* the predictable and stable releases from the release process
* good security practices
