### nodejs/next-10

* Technical Priority Deep Dive - Documentation [#89](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/89)

    consistent and well structured docs.
  * Tierney is going to put together an issue in the Next-10
    repo with proposal that includes: benefits, approach, next steps
  * Discussed translations, is this key/holding us back ?
    * Python/ruby do have a number of translations
    * For Java we did not find any
    * Certifications were translated
  * Maybe we can ask the Foundation in terms of how they see the importance
  * Tierney looking at where we get downloads/not might also give us some info
  * Electron uses crowdin
  * Michael will open issue to discuss how critical we think translations are to future Node.js success

* Planning deep dives
  * We discussed that it seems hard to get regular attendance. Still finding a good time.
  * Beth suggested could make sense to repeat the mini-summit that seemed to work pretty well.
  * We agreed to do mini summit covering these two topics
    * Suitable types for end-users
    * Single Executable Applications
  * Michael will create issue to plan mini-summit

* deep dive on Maintaining/growing the level of contribution in future Next-10 meeting  [#86](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/86)
  * skipped as we were out of time

* Draft content of technical priorities for PR to Node.js core [#84](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/84)
