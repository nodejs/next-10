* Create Communications Channel to JS Newsletters/Periodicals [#110](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/110)
  * Joe had reached out to group that provides newsletter and they are interested
  * Michael key question
    * How do we put requests in a place where the PR/Comms people from the newsletters will
      watch/see
    * How do we easily let collaborators identify topics that should be fed to those groups
  * Bradley there are different crowds
    * many developers don’t have social media
    * youtube, tens of thousands that just use youtube for their news
    * blogs/news
    * newsletters, is a good first step to other
  * Joe sounds like problem is “making sure wider community is aware of changes, so they are
    no surprised”
  * Bradley
    * already have twitter automation
    * maybe we can just tag issues that should be surfaced
    * problem is there is lack of explanation for things like notable changes

  * Initial solution
    * News repo with template for adding potential news items
    * Ask Foundation Comms team to review weely, generate summary and email onto newsletter contacts
    * Email Alex (or some Foundation email) to be added to list
    * Joe will confirm that that approach makes sense to Fondation.
