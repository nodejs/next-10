### nodejs/next-10

* We continued to work through the survey results
  * Q12
    * most people 56% use nvm
    * 22% donâ€™t use one
    * 28% of people use one of the others
    * might be good to try to exclude production deployments
  * Q13
    * 58% one version install globally
    * corepack or equivalent 25%
    * containers 13%
    * For next year, reword to make it a bit clearer
  * Q14
    * All of the priorities were greater than 25% except for WebAssembly which was around 18%
    * Should we dive into some of those more specifically, maybe choose one or two
    * Or possibly add text area that asks for more info about the priorities that they have asked for
  * Q15
    * Seems like we got a good representation from through outside the project as those related
      to project are low
    * Possibly next year filter down to make survey more external stakeholder focussed.
    * Have a separate collaborator survey
  * Q16
    * 71% of code includes ES module syntax, we were a bit surprised, thought it would be the
      inverse.
    * Not totally convinced we asked the question in a way that got accurate results
    * Something to think on, and we should likely made the question clearer next year
    * Add an unsure as an option
  * Q17
    * Pain points
      * dirname and file name
      * TypeScript/esm interop
      * Jest
      * Michael, drive desired content for Ambassador program from common issues
  * Q18
    * We need to look for common problems again.
  * Q19
    * experimental features
    * corepack at 28%, Async hooks at 32%
  * Q20 - new stable features
    * 87% on fetch
  * Will finish up next time.
