### nodejs/next-10

* Survey to get feedback on needs of constituencies [#48](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/48)

  * Good review/discussion on constituencies as reported in the survey.  
  * From that agreed we should add 2 new constituencies(still need a bit of refinement):
    * Education: Teachers, students, programs to help people learn Node.js(college, University, boot camps, learning resources etc.), programs to help people demonstrate capability(certification programs).
    * Security Practitioners: people involved in the life-cycle of security issues. Penetration testing, incident response, CVE scanning, remediation, legal, PR. etc.
  * We also agreed we needed to tweak the content of the others a bit
    * [Wes] Add cli support to the app developer/lib author/end user
    * [Michael] - What about standards?

* Key Technical Areas - Brainstorm to generate list [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/39)
  * Ran out of time, will cover next time

* Next 10 years for collaborators [#16](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/16)
